2. Maintain matriculation
3. Meet all housing application and payment deadlines, and
4. Do not cancel their housing for reasons other than a school-approved medical leave or study away program

Non-renewable housing status: Returning undergraduates who miss application deadlines, graduate and visiting students, and new transfer students are offered housing based on space availability. Since on campus housing is not guaranteed, these students are strongly encouraged to seek their own accommodations.
NYU BobChat
The housing application has two phases:
1. Complete your housing application on the NYU Global Home Housing Forms card. Renewable status applicants must submit a $1,000 housing reservation payment.

2. Complete the online room selection as it becomes available.
